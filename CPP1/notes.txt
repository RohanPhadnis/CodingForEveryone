C vs C++
- C
    - inventor: Ritchie
    - year: 1972
    - size: small, 29 keywords
    - type: System Implementation Language (SIL)
    - supports: imperative programming
    - subset of C++
- C++
    - inventor: Stroustrup
    - year: 1985
    - size: large, 63 keywords
    - supports: imperative programming, "swiss army knife" also supports OOP and generic programming
    - extension of C
- Why C++ is better
    - More type safety
    - More libraries
    - Less dependence on preprocessor
    - OOP


Java vs C++
- Java
    - pure OOP
    - Philosophy: high-level
        - C++ is low-level
    - developer: Sun
    - inspiration: smalltalk with C syntax
    - JVM - universal semantics
        - C++ originally compiled to C
        - C++ no hidden overhead
    - Ergo no Garbage Collection and default not virtual function call


The C Program has 3 main parts:
    1. Standard Libraries
    2. Macros and Preprocessor Commands
    3. main() function


Libraries and Namespaces in C++
    - c++ include statements dont require the .h for header files
    - if c is the starting character of the library, it indicates that it is also a library in c (eg ctime, cstdlib)
    - namespace is a wrapper for tools in a library
    - namespace is an encapsulation; encapsulation is a key principle for isolating operations to a library and minimizing outside interactions
    - using keyword indicates that that namespace is being used by the program
    - using defines the scope of the program
    - if using
        - cout << "Hello World!";
    - if not using
        - std::cout << "Hello World!";
    - :: is the scope resolution operator


inline keyword
    - incline used to declare functions
    - the code from the body is executed in-line by the compiler, instead of creating a new stack for that function
    - this speeds up runtime execution
    - better than textual substitution of #define macros
    - Rules for when to NOT use inline:
        - If a function contains a loop. (for, while and do-while)
        - If a function contains static variables.
        - If a function is recursive.
        - If a function return type is other than void, and the return statement doesnâ€™t exist in a function body.
        - If a function contains a switch or goto statement.


const keyword
    - used to declare constants
    - syntax: const <type> <identifier> = <value>;
    - eg: const double pi = 3.14159;
    - replaces macro #define which is unsafe and uses textual substitution


iostream
    - cout used to display output; type is ostream
        - cout << "Hello World!";
        - endl is for newline; type is iomanipulator
    - cin used to take input; type is istream
        - int x;
        - cin >> x;
    - << and >> bitwise shift operators are overloaded


Heap-based Memory Keywords
    - malloc in c is replaced by new keyword in c++
    - free in c is replaced by delete keyword in c++
    - accessing heap memory
        - ex
            int* p = new int(9);    // initializing a new int
            char* array = new char[5];  // initializing an array of 5 chars
            delete p;   // deallocating memory
            delete [] array; // deallocating memory - notice [] for arrays


Casting
    - C casting is also supported in C++
        - syntax: (type) value
        - eg: (double) 1 == 1.0
    - C++ has a more secure casting method called static_cast
        - static_cast<type>(value)
        - only performs the cast if the casting is supported; else throws an error
        - static_cast<double>(1) == 1.0


Overloading
    - Multiple methods with the same name can exist and are differentiated by their method signatures.
    - Method signature: types and number of parameters.
    - C++ does signature matching based on runtime arguments


Call by Reference
    - C++ supports pass by reference, call by reference unlike C
    - <datatype>& is read as reference to <datatype>. used for call by reference cases
        - int& is read as reference to int


Generics
    - C++ supports generics. Generics are a way to generalize code for any input data types.
    - template and class keywords are used to define generic
        - template <class T>
        - T can be used then to describe any inputs. the actual data type will be deduced during runtime.
        - T is a meta variable which will be replaced by the arguments' actual data type
    - multiple templates can be created for dealing with numerous generic types
        - template <class T1, class T2>


Optional Parameters
    - A function can have optional parameters. Default values specified in method header.
        - void print(char* text = "hi") {}
        - print()
        - print("hello")
    - Allows for different signatures


Const Correctness
    - A function can define a parameter to be const. This means that the function itself does not modify this parameter.
        - int sum(const int x, const int y)
    - A function can also be const in declaration, to express that it does not modify the object
        - Example

        class Point {
        public:
            double get_x() const {
                return x;
            }
        private:
            double x;
            double y;
        };


C++ Casting
    - static_cast<type>(val) - safe cast
    - reinterpret_cast<type>(val) - highly unsafe cast; equivalent to (type) val
    - dynamic_cast<type>(val) - used with classes
    - const_cast<type>(val) - casts away const-ness


Graph Theory
    - Very important topic in Computer Science
    - Applications encompass but are not limited to:
        - Artificial Intelligence similarity algorithms
        - GPS algorithms
        - Internet routing
        - database queries
    - Vocabulary
        - graph - a network of nodes and edges
        - node - an element in a graph; AKA vertex
        - edge - a path used to travel between nodes
        - complete graph - a graph in which every node has a connection to every other node
            - K notation: K4 is a complete graph with 4 nodes; K5 is a complete graph with 5 nodes...
        - directed edge - edge with a direction
        - undirected edge - edge in which direction of travel is not restricted
        - degree of a node - number of edges connected into the node
        - connected graph - there is at least one path from any node to any other node in the graph
        - weighted edge - edge with a cost of traversal (ex. distance)
        - density - probability an edge exists
            - in range [0, 1]
            - 0 means the graph is unconnected
            - 1 means the graph is complete
            - keeping density constant, as the size of a graph increases, the likelyhood of it being connected also increases
        - spanning tree - a set of edges which connects all nodes on a graph, without cycles; n nodes in graph, n-1 edges in spanning tree
        - minimum spanning tree (mst) - a spanning tree made using the least cumulative cost of edge traversal



Graph Data Structure
    - Graph is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)
    - There are 2 implementations of graphs, each with its own tradeoffs
        - Connectivity matrix - better for dense graphs
        - Edge list representation - better for sparse graphs
    - List Representation
        - Definition: a representation of a directed graph with n vertices using an array of n lists of vertices
        - List i contains vertex j if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j
        - A weighted graph may be represented with a list of vertex / weight pairs
        - An undirected graph may be represented by having vertex j in the list for vertex i and vertex i in the list for vertex j
    - Example:
        - Matrix representation
            - row at index i represents the connections for node i
            - columns represent nodes to connect with
                1   2   3   4
            1   1   1   1   1
            2   1   0   0   0
            3   0   1   0   1
            4   0   1   1   0
        - List representation
            1: 1, 2, 3, 4
            2: 1
            3: 2, 4
            4: 2, 3


Graph Traversal
    - Breadth First Search (BFS)
        - visiting all immediately adjacent nodes before exploring more
        - open set with all reachable nodes and closed set with all explored nodes
        - can be used to determine if a graph is connected
    - Depth First Search (DFS)
        - entirely exploring a single branch before exploring new branches


Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Finds the shortest path in a graph between 2 nodes.
    - Starts at starting node and does a weighted BFS.
    - 2 data structures: visited set and priority queue
    - visited set starts out with starting node (dist = 0)
    - all neighbours are added to min heap priority queue, sorted by distance.
    - elements are removed from the priority queue, placed in the visited set, their neighbours added to priority queue


Enums
    - Supported by C++ and newer versions of C.
    - Used to define a related set of constants
        - syntax: enum colors{RED, BLUE, GREEN};
        - RED = 0; BLUE = 1; GREEN = 2;


Operator Overloading
    - For using operators on non-native types.
    - Order of precedence of operators cannot be changed.
    - Used with unary and binary operations; ternary operators cannot be overloaded.
    - syntax:
        inline <return type> operator<symbol> (params) {}
        - params corresponds to operands and can be 1 or 2, depending on operator.


Object-Oriented Programming
    - Vocabulary
        - class: a blueprint for creating objects
        - object: an instance of a class
        - private method/attribute: restricted only to the class itself
        - public method/attribute: visible to any script
        - protected method/attribute: visible only to subclasses
        - accessor methods: methods to get private instance data
        - mutator methods: methods to modify private instance data
        - constructor: method to build an object; initialize objects; convert to object; allocate memory for object
        - default constructor: constructor with no arguments
        - copy constructor: constructor that creates a deep copy of an existing instance of that class
        - destructor: method to deallocate object from heap memory


Classes in C++
    - syntax:

    class <class name> {
    private:
        // private methods/attributes
    public:
        // public methods/attributes

        // constructor
        <class name>(<params>) {
        }
    };


Constructor with Initializer List
    - Initializer list allows for value assignment to attributes
    - better than initializing in body of constructor method because accounts for const attributes
        - if an attribute is const, cannot assign traditional way
    - Point example:

    class Point {
    private:
        double x;
        double y;
    pubic:
        // traditional way
        Point(double x, double y) {
            this->x = x;
            this->y = y;
        }

        // with initializer list
        Point(x, y):x(x), y(y){}
    }


Destructor
    - Used to deallocate heap-based memory
    - Defined using the ~ symbol
    - takes no params
    - called when scope of object is erased or when the delete keyword is used
    - Example

        class <class name> {
        public:

            // constructor
            <class name>(<params>) {}

            // destructor
            ~<class name>{}
        };


Null Pointers
    - Keyword nullptr is used for null pointers. Alternatively, NULL or 0 can also be used.


Singly Linked List
    - A Singly Linked List is a data structure to implement the list ADT.
    - It stores each element as node containing the data for that element and a pointer to the node with the next element.
    - Iterations continue until the current pointer is NULL.


Copies
    - Shallow/Referential Copy - a copy to the same address, meaning that modifications will affect all other copies; more efficient but less useful
    - Deep Copy - a copy in which data is copied to newer addresses, meaning that the new object is equivalent but not the exact same
        - deep copy constructor must have a const parameter


Prim's Algorithm
    - Algorithm for fining MST, given a start node
    - Greedy Algorithm Approach
    - Has an open set and a closed set
    - Closed set contains all currently explored nodes
    - Open set contains reachable nodes
    - Least costly path from open set is chosen


Greedy Algorithm
    - An algorithm that works by utilizing local min/max values to find a globally optimal solution.
    - Not all greedy algorithms always work.
        - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
            - finding shortest linear path that connects all nodes in a graph
            - a greedy approach is to take the shortest reachable edge at each node
            - not guaranteed to give the best solution, but a good heuristic approximation
    - Prim and Dijkstra are greedy algorithms that ALWAYS work


Kruskal's Algorithm
    - Algorithm for finding an MST
    - Forest - a set of trees
    - Creates a forest with each node as a separate tree
    - Takes the least costly reachable edge
        - if the edge connects separate trees, the trees are combined into one
        - else, the edge will form a loop and must be discarded
